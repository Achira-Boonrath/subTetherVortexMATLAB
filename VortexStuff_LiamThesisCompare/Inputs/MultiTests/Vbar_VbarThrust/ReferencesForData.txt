From JGCD on capture of cylinder:
- Coefficients for contact (poisson's ratio, young's modulus)
- static friction coefficients: Kevlar-Kevlar pairs = Nylon-Nylon pairs 
				Aluminum-Kevlar = Aluminum-Teflon pairs
- kinetic friction coefficients: estimated by dividing the static ones by 1.25. 
- contact stiffness of the net nodes was divided by 10 in order to balance the fact that the mass is lumped in the nodes.
- linear stiffness of contact approx with max penetration. justied by the fact that, if damping is temporarily neglected, Fn = k*delta should approximate linearly Fn = k_nonlin*delta^1.5 while passing through zero.
